Emma and Jerry like to watch movies. No, actually, Emma and Jerry love to watch
movies. They have only one tiny problem. They never like the same movies . . .
Emma likes horror movies. She likes the fear and the blood.
Jerry, on the other hand, hates horror movies. He hates the fear and the blood. He
likes love stories. He likes romantic couples and happy endings.
Emma hates romantic movies.
